import { PostList } from ".";

## React Component for Core

A component that references all other compound components. This simplifies the number of components external consumers need to import.

```js live
<PostList
  variant="default"
  posts={{ nodes: [{ slug: 'find-help', title: 'Find Help' }] }}
/>
```
