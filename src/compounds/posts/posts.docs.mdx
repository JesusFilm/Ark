## React Component for rendering multiple posts

This is a compound component to render multiple posts. It takes in varying number of posts and chooses an optimal layout for them. Each post links to the post's independent page.

### Using props to customize the way posts are listed.

Modify the props to see it change live:
```js live
  <Posts
    Link={({ children, href, className }) =>
      React.createElement('a', { children, className, href: `/posts/${href}` })
    }
    posts={{
      nodes: [
        {
          featuredImage: {
            node: {
              sourceUrl: 'https://source.unsplash.com/1920x1080/daily?doubt'
            }
          },
          slug: '10-bible-verses-about-faith-and-doubt',
          title: '10 Bible Verses about Faith and Doubt',
          excerpt:
            "Issues of faith and doubt have a massive impact on Christians of every maturity level. And sometimes, the topic is presented in ways that are confusing and only increase people's anxiety about their doubt."
        }
      ]
    }}
  />
```
