import { Card } from "./card";

## Usage Guidelines

- Call To Action button will only be displayed if action is a string and onClick props are provided
- If action is a component then onClick prop will be ignored

## Using the hero component

```js live
<Card
  src="https://www.jesusfilm.org/content/dam/jesusfilm/homepage/hero/jesus-broadcast-easter.png"
  title="Send People Jesus this Easter"
  subtitle="Help share the hope of Jesus through TV and Radio Broadcasts!"
  action="Give them Jesus"
  onClick={() => alert("button clicked")}
/>
```
