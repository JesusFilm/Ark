## React Component for rendering text

A basic div that renders some text

### Using props to customize the text

Modify the text to see it change live:
```js live
<CoreParagraph block={{
        __typename: 'CoreParagraphBlock',
        attributes: {
          content:
            "When people talk about the ministry of Jesus, it's easy to focus on his miracles. Jesus performed some amazing feats that the world had never seen (and hasnâ€™t seen since). But one of the most exciting things about His ministry was His teaching style."
        }
      }} /> 
```
